# Dynascape

A turn based RPG made in Unity2D by Martijn Klok, (https://github.com/MKlok)

This project was made as a test exam with four weeks of documentation and four weeks of programming.
Inside this project there are the basics of a modified take on the classic RPG combat and movement system.
In here the following functionalities can be found:
 - Overworld movement and location storage
 - Random encounters
 - Basic Enemy AI
 - Different player actions

A zip with the final build is included in the repository.
The controls for the game are as follows:

**Overworld:**
 - Movement: W A S D
 - Pause: Escape
 
**Combat**
 - Target / action selection: Mouse click
